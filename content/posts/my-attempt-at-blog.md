Previously, I had a website based on Jekyll, but I didn't post much on it. Later, I realized that I come across a lot of new things each day. It would be a good idea if I shared what I learned. Not only will it help me with future references, but others as well.

I intend to write about all topics that interest me, in no particular order:

- Linux System Administration

- Self-hosting and similar stuff

- Things I Use (Software, Hardware)

- Shows: I watch a lot of shows, although I don't binge-watch. I think I will talk about them as well.

I hope you will enjoy it.
